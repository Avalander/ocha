# Ocha

This is a learning project. The goal is to implement a simple web framework on top of node's [http server](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server).

- No dependencies (except maybe [Fluture](https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture) for handling asynchronous tasks).
- Handle JSON out of the box.
